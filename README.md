Tweetifire is an app to provide instant response to a tweet during a disaster. It collects tweets from the twitter and uses a machine learning model trained on sample tweets,preclassified in need and availibility classes, to predict the probability of each tweet into avilability annd need related tweets.<br/><br/>Need tweets refer to tweets showing requirement of some resources.<br/>Availability tweets are the tweets depicting the extra resources available.<br/><br>It then segregates all need related tweets and all avaibility related tweets into separate sections.

 This app would be useful for the govt. and army officials to provide help to people who are in need and also those who have extra resources avilable can be helpful to those in need through this app. The even distribution of excess resources can be facilitated by the use of this app.

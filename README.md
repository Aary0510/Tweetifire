 Tweetifire is an app to provide instant response to a tweet during a disaster. It collects tweets from the twitter app and uses a machine learning model trained on sampple need and availability tweets to predict the probability of each tweet into avilability annd need related tweets. It then segregates all need related tweets and al avillability related tweeets into separate sections.
 
  This app would be useful for the govt. and army officials to provide help to people who are in need and also those who have extra resources avilable can be helpful to those in need through this app. The even distribution of excess resources can be facilitated by the use of this app.

Tweetifire is an web app to provide instant response to a tweet during a disaster. It uses a machine learning model trained on sample tweets, preclassified in need and availability classes, to predict the probability of each tweet into availability and need related tweets.<br/><br/>
• Need tweets refer to tweets showing requirement of some resources.<br/>
• Availability tweets are the tweets depicting the extra resources available.<br/><br>It then segregates need related tweets and availability related tweets into separate sections.

 This app would be useful for the govt. and army officials to provide help to people who are in need and also those who have extra resources available can be helpful to those in need through this app. The even distribution of excess resources can be facilitated by the use of this app.
